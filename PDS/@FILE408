//*    It is preferred that Dave's free software be obtained        *   FILE 408

//*    but we are keeping a copy of his updated macro library here  *   FILE 408
//*    in case somebody is desperate to assemble something, and it  *   FILE 408
//*    is difficult to get to Dave's web site on a given day, so    *   FILE 408
//*    see member NEWMACLB which is Dave's new macro library as     *   FILE 408
//*    of August 2005, in PDSLOAD (IEBUPDTE SYSIN) format.          *   FILE 408

//*    Member MOREMACS will probably not be necessary for anything  *   FILE 408
//*    you need, but it has been included because it includes the   *   FILE 408

//*    program.  The new copy is in member NEWSTUFF of File 199,    *   FILE 408
